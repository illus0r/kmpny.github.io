The floats are assembled from pre-drawn sections. Not in any way, but according to the rules described in the [generating grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_grammar). It defines possible combinations of float parts: what types of sections they contain and in what order they go.

The sequence is a random, but the randomness depends on the content of the text field. The same values will draw the same floats.
